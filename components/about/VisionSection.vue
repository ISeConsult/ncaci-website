                <p class="font-thin text-base">
                    The desire of The New Covenant Apostolic Church Int. is to provide spiritual direction for those endeavouring in the pursuit of holy living. As a people of God, we commit body, Soul and ourselves to the building up of God's Kingdom. The NCACI will continue to develop an affront against the wiles of the adversary through educational avenues, crusades, and other viable means. Many "Apostolic" churches have structured themselves to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ to the lost and dying world: we support them in their endeavours. Realizing that our churches are experiencing turbulent situations, the need for restoration within our local assemblies is paramount. Evangelism, taken to the next level requires us to remain cognizant that "The Excellency of the power is of God and not us."

                    The membership of the church consists of saved individuals who are in the body of Christ. We believe that our members must attend church service regularly as the Scriptures have instructed (Heb, 10:25). True membership depends on one’s acceptance and obedience to the order and office of the church, namely:
                </p>
                <p class="font-thin text-base mb-8">
                    Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, etc. We believe that Jesus Christ is coming again for His church namely the born again people. We believe in baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that every member must be subject to the Pastor and those who have rule over them.
