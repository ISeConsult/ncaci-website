# Internationalization Fix for Navbar and Footer

## Tasks
- [ ] Update Navbar.vue to use $t for navigation item names instead of hardcoded English strings.
- [ ] Update Footer.vue to replace all hardcoded English strings with $t calls using existing translations.
- [ ] Test the changes by running the app and switching languages.

## Notes
- Locale files already contain translations for navbar and footer.
- Hero section already works correctly with $t.
- Language switcher in Navbar.vue appears functional.
